# BA Thesis Sociology 2024 - Scripts and Appendices 

This repository contains R scripts and appendices complementing the bachelor theses of Sociology students at the VU Amsterdam (2024). 
The repository is used by students writing their thesis under Sarah Sramota (Group 8), Jasper Muis (Group 10) and Joris Rijbroek (Group 1). 

For students: if you already have a Github account, create your own folder within this repository and upload all relevant files. Make sure to refer to the correct folder within your thesis. If you don't have a Github account, you can either make one or have the script uploaded by your supervisor.
