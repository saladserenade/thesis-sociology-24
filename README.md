# BA Thesis Sociology 2024 - Scripts and Appendices 

This repository contains R scripts and appendices complementing the bachelor theses of Sociology students at the VU Amsterdam (2024). 
The repository is used by students writing their thesis under Sarah Sramota (Group 8), Jasper Muis (Group 10) and Joris Rijbroek (Group 1). 

For students: if you already have a Github account, create your own folder within this repository and upload all relevant files. The easiest is to put all relevant files in a folder on your computer called [first name + surname] and **upload the folder as a whole**. Make sure to refer to the correct link(s) within your thesis. If you don't have a Github account, you can either make one or have your files uploaded by your supervisor.
